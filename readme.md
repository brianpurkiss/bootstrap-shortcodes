# Bootstrap Shortcodes Plugin

This is a simple WordPress plugin to use shortcodes for Bootstrap 4 elements.

This won't include all Bootstrap elements. For example, it won't include the navbar. However, more shortcodes will be added... eventually.


## Included Shortcodes

**Card**

`[card float="right" img="img.jpg" alt="Image Alt"]test text here[/card]`

* Float options are left, right, or center. Defaults to right.
* Width default is 300px


**Images**

`[img float="right" img="img.jpg" alt="Image Alt"]`

* Float options are: left, right, center, [blank]
