# Bootstrap Shortcodes Plugin

This is a simple WordPress plugin to use shortcodes for Bootstrap 4 elements.

This won't include all Bootstrap elements. For example, it won't include the navbar. However, more shortcodes will be added... eventually.


## Included Shortcodes

**Card**

`[card title="test title" float="right" img="img.jpg" alt="Image Alt"]test text here[/card]`

Works with or without float.

**Images**

[img float="right" img="img.jpg" alt="Image Alt"]

Works with or without float.
